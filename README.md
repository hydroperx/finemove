# Fine-Move

Controlling a 2D automobile with just 4 arrow keys.

## 2D coordinates

* $x = \text{horizontal position from -Infinity to zero to +Infinity}$
* $y = \text{vertical position from -Infinity to zero to +Infinity}$
* $w = \text{rotation ratio (percentage, radians, or degrees) from -Infinity to zero to +Infinity}$

The rotation ($w$) is often expressed as degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 360, ...).

* 90째 degrees means *lie to the next side*.
* 180째 degrees means *lie to the bottom*.
* 360째 degrees is the identity rotation, viewed the same way as 0째 degrees.

A rotation changes either in the clockwise direction, or in the counter clockwise direction, or is in inertia.

## Keyboard Layout

For the Fine Move, just 4 arrows are enough, positioned as in the following picture.

The automobile may perform one of the following combinations:

* UP (NORTH)
* UP-LEFT (NORTHWEST)
* UP-RIGHT (NORTHEAST)
* DOWN (SOUTH)
* DOWN-LEFT (SOUTHWEST)
* DOWN-RIGHT (SOUTHEAST)

The automobile moves smoothly or abruptly to that combination's direction according to key pressure.

## Performing a Drift

The automobile is a box into a larger circunference which is partitioned into 4 parts, forming 4 triangles each with a uniform curved hypotenuse side.

How the automobile moves depends in its box rotation (commonly in degrees); the pressed combination causes:

* the automobile's box to rotate (either clockwise, counter clockwise, or inertia);
* the $x, y$ coordinates each change according to simple trigonometric functions.

## Sine, cosine, and tangent

The mathematical $sin$, $cos$, and $tan$ functions take an angle and yield a ratio of one of the sides of an abstract triangle inside one of the 4 slices of the circunference that matches the given angle. These functions are used for moving an automobile, for example.

* The adjacent side is the one that is preceded by the hypotenuse and followed by the opposite side; it is often the starting side.
* $sin$ = the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse ("SOH")
* $cos$ = the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse ("CAH")
* $tan$ = the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side ("TOA"). Tangent goes from the opposite side next to the hypotenuse and finishes at the adjacent side next to the hypotenuse.

The ratio is usually a decimal from 0 to 1 (for example: 0, 0.5, 1).

The function takes the angle either in degrees or radians.
